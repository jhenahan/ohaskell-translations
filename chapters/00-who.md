And I'm an ordinary programmer. An autodidact. I once thought that software development is the most boring kind of human activity. For the last eight years I think it's one of the most interesting professions.

Fred Brooks was right, there's no silver bullet. But we're looking for new tools to deal with our daily tasks. So, after 7 years of programming in C++, I, striving for greater efficiency, decided to look for something new.

Honestly, I was tired of the complexity of C++. Yes, it's a very good language (especially C++11), but I wanted something different... Something natively compilable, something high-level, with static typing, with beautiful syntax, general-purpose, and... something simpler. Yes, I wanted just that. I stumbled upon Haskell - and I was immediately hooked.

First of all, the lack of an assignment operator. This fact shocked me, and I decided to investigate this.

Second, the beauty. I love beautiful code, and Haskell code can be really beautiful.

Third, the power. Keep reading, and you'll see it soon.

And finally, the simplicity. Yes, simplicity. I know that functional programming do not usually associates with the word "simple". In particular, there's a rumor that studying Haskell is extremely complex. But I repeat: this language amazed me with its simplicity. And you'll see what I mean.
